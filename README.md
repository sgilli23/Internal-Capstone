# Internal-Capstone

This is my employee database programme.

I have kept it very simple so that it is as easy to use as posible and sticks to the brief.

I chose to use traditional buttons over radio buttons as in my past job when I had to use a similar system, radio buttons
were cumbersome, especially when having to use them on a touchscreen device. I have then disabled these upon user selecting
an option. They will then re-enable upon clicking reset.

The selector lists are also set up so that they disable if they don't pertain to the user's query. 

I could have hidden the selectors/buttons when they were not in use, but as I chose to do this for the Intro to Web Dev
course, I wanted to try something I hadn't yet done. I also think that by doing it in this way, the design is in keeping
with the purpose of the programme overall... and looks a bit cleaner. However, this could be changed based on the clients wishes.

I've created 2 additional buttons = one that reloads the page and therefore grabs another random 20 employees, and another
which resets all the buttons and selectors so the user can make another selection on the original payload of data.

My styling is inspired by WYWM's frequent referencing of one of the greatest video games of all time. I've tries to keep
the themeing and colours consistent throughout so it's easy on the eyes. I also personally always have dark-mode switched on
as it's more accessible for me so I quite like it being all black.
